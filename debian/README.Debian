Upstream Bug Tracker:
=====================

The recommended way to report non-packaging problems (e.g. graphics
distortions, unsupported graphics cards, crashes, ...) directly to AMD
is to use the Unofficial AMD Linux Bugzilla at

    http://ati.cchtml.com/

Please include a link to such an upstream bug report when filing the
problem in your Linux distribution's bug tracking system.

As of January 2013 there is also a new Support Ticket Process by AMD:

    http://support.amd.com/us/kbarticles/Pages/ticketprocess.aspx


This driver will replace parts of your X11/Mesa system:
=======================================================
If you encounter problems with the proprietary fglrx driver and want to
switch back to a free driver, e.g. vesa or radeon, you have to re-enable
the MESA libraries and corresponding Xorg modules by running

    update-alternatives --config glx

and selecting MESA.
Don't forget to manually disable fglrx in your /etc/X11/xorg.conf, too.


Installing fglrx with 3d acceleration support:
==============================================
First you have to install the "fglrx-modules-dkms" package with apt:
	# apt-get install fglrx-modules-dkms
Also the rest of the needed fglrx packages.

Now you can create the initial config by typing:
	# aticonfig --initial

This will work for most simple driver/monitor setups, but you may have
a look at
	# aticonfig --help
for all supported options (like dual head).

Now you should reboot and have a fine running fglrx with 3d acceleration
support.


Unsupported combination: 32-bit Xserver with 64-bit kernel:
===========================================================
FGLRX does not work on a 64/32 mix architecture (i386 with an amd64 kernel).
Upstream does not support it and we also do not want to.
It is possible to patch the module so that it builds on 64/32, but it fails
to work *at all*. This has been acknowledged by AMD.


Screen flickering with VariBright enabled:
==========================================
fglrx contains a feature called "VariBright" which tries to automatically
adjust screen brightness to screen content in order to save power.
Under certain circumstances, this may exhibit a seemingly arbitrary
"flickering" of the screen. You can disable this feature in the power
options of amdcccle (Catalyst Control Center, included in fglrx-control).
