BUGS observed in 8.32.5: 

aticonfig:
==========

- aticonfig -i /etc/X11/xorg.conf -o ~/test/xorg.conf
	No need to back up anything.
	Misses a newline after this phrase.

- typo in --tv-overscan: "and" should be "an" in the note

- using --tv-geometry says:

  failed to set tv geometry.
  check help for possible causes.
  
  But help doesn't tell anything useful to determine the cause of this failure. Does it
  check, if TV is connected? Why could it fail?

- trying to use --tv-geometry option only giving width and height results in a broken
  entry Option "TVVSizeAdj" "--tv-geometry=value" in aticonfig(1x). Also the leading
  sign of the given pixels offsets from centre are not preserved (I guess, this should
  be preserved, but I'm not sure), when creating the entries for Option "TVHPosAdj" and TVVPosAdj

- following the -h output, aticonfig should support reading from stdin and writing to stdout
  when using the --input or --output options - but it doesn't work as expected and you will
  receive error messages or a file named "-"

- --dw and similar is still accpeted, but not longer documented (seems obsolete) and not checked
  for its option value

- in --help output "Dynamic Display Management Options" it is written, that these options will
  not affect the config file, but this is not true:
  `aticonfig --enable-monitor=string1,string2 -i ~/test.conf -o ~/test2.conf' disproves the
  statement (an entry is made for EnableMonitors).


fglrxinfo:
==========

- `fglrxinfo --help' says "Usage: fireglinfo [Options]", but it should be
  "Usage: fglrxinfo [Options]" instead
