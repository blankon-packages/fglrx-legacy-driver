Revision 8.28.8         2006-08-18      dale, ATI Technologies Inc.
New upstream release ATI Proprietary Linux Driver Version 8.28.8.

Because I did not made manpage releases for ATI Proprietary Linux Driver
Versions 8.25.18, 8.26.18 and 8.27.10, this ChangeLog is quite long.

[Important] Important
            Be aware, that this driver is the last with support for RADEON®
            8500/9000/9100/9200/9250, MOBILITY™ RADEON® 9000/9100/9200 and
            RADEON® IGP 9000/9100/9200 chipsets.

General changes:

  ● The license has changed to a MIT license.

  ● Updated the list of supported chipsets.

  ● Fixed many build issues and improved the build system in several ways.

  ● Added a XML-based revision history and dropped the plain-text based one
    (this means, that there is still a text version, but it's created from the
    XML file and a HTML version was added).

  ● Fixed format issues in all manpages, that clashed with the format
    recommendations of manpages.

  ● Fixed many markup issues in aticonfig(1x), fgl_glxgears(1x), fglrxinfo(1x),
    fglrx_xgamma(1x) and fglrx(4x).

  ● Fixed several typos in aticonfig(1x) and fglrx(4x).

  ● The HTML form of the manpages now uses HTML 4.01 transitional.

Special changes for aticonfig(1x):

  ● Fixed copyright.

  ● Added some information if and how options affect the configuration file
    (taken from aticonfig --help output).

  ● Added some general section descriptions based on the information given by
    the --help of aticonfig(1x).

  ● Added the description for the newly introduced options:

    --add-pairmode
    --enable-monitor
    --list-pairmode
    --locked-userpages
    --max-gart-size
    --nobackup
    --query-monitor
    --remove-pairmode
    --swap-monitor
    --set-policy
    --tv-geometry
    --tv-info
    --tv-overscan

with descriptions.

  ● Improved and updated the description for the options:

    --initial
    --tvf,--tv-format-type
    -o, --output

  ● Removed the description for the no longer available options:

    --agpl, --agp-locked-userpages
    --dw,--disable-workstation
    --iagp, --internal-agp

  ● Removed solved or obsolete bugs:

      ○ The --tv-format-type option does not longer try to manipulate the
        Option "TVStandard" value of fglrx(4x).

      ○ Trying to use --dw timmo-extreme returns the following error message:
        “aticonfig: parsing the command-line failed”.

    Added newly observed bugs:

      ○ The --tvf option does not accept all values mentioned in the --help
        output.

      ○ The --tv-info option could freeze with 100% CPU usage.

      ○ The --tv-geometry may break the configuration file or output a wrong
        error message.

      ○ The --help output is wrong in a few cases.

    Check the “BUGS” section of aticonfig(1x) for more information.

Special changes for fglrx(4x):

  ● Fixed copyright.

  ● Updated, sorted and reorganized the list of supported chipsets and their
    supported features.

  ● Added new explanations for the options:

    Option "MaxGARTSize"
    Option "TVOverscan"

    Updated and improved explanations for the options:

    Option "ForceMonitors"
    Option "TVFormat"
    Option "TVHPosAdj"
    Option "TVHSizeAdj"
    Option "TVVPosAdj"
    Option "TVVSizeAdj"

Special changes for fglrxrc(5):

  ● Added the involved files, this manpage is about.

Option "EnableMonitor"
Option "MaxGARTSize"
Option "PairModes"
Option "TVOverscan"

Obsoleted driver options (may be incomplete): unknown
