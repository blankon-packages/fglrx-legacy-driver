  * Install a list of supported PCI IDs as /usr/share/fglrx/fglrx.ids.
  * Cleanup maintainer scripts and debian/control.
  * Enable multiarch build.
    - Add and use _LIBDIR_ substitution variable.
    - Add Pre-Depends: ${misc:Pre-Depends}.
    - Add Multi-Arch: same.
    - Bump debhelper dependency to 8.1.3 and compat level to 9.
    - Add Build-Depends: rpl and edit fglrx-libGL.so.1.2 with rpl to contain a
      sane search path of ${ORIGIN}/dri for the dri module, s.t. it is still
      found after moving it to the multiarch directory.
    - Add a symlink from /usr/lib/*/dri/fglrx_dri.so to /usr/lib/dri/ s.t.
      fglrx-libglx.so can still find the fglrx_dri.so module.
  * Move shared libraries from fglrx-driver package to new package libfglrx.
    Further splitting does not look promising as there are several libraries
    without proper SONAME and libraries from different upstream releases may
    not be mixed.
  * Move shared libraries (except for libGL.so.1) from fglrx-glx-ia32 package
    to new package libfglrx-ia32.
  * Install the same libraries in libfglrx-ia32 as in libfglrx. E.g. 32-bit
    OpenCL applications need libatical*.so.
  * Move AMD XvBA development files from fglrx-driver package to new package
    libxvbaw-dev.
  * Rename package fglrx-glx to libgl1-fglrx-glx. Keep old name as
    transitional package.
  * Prevent concurrent installation of multiarch packages (lib*:i386) and
    their corresponding biarch packages (lib*-ia32:amd64).
  * Ensure no mismatching versions of fglrx-driver and libgl1-fglrx-glx can be

  * Override the experimental lintian tag shlib-calls-exit.
  * Resurrect the fglrx-source package.
  * Add alternate recomends fglrx-kernel-${fglrx:version} to fglrx-driver,
    this virtual package is provided by the dkms package and the module
    packages built from fglrx-source.
  * Prepare support for squeeze-backports:
    - Add instructions for squeeze-backports to README.source and a
      prepare-squeeze-backport target to debian/rules that performs the
      necessary changes.
    - Re-add some maintainer script code to cleanup after the
      /emul/ia32-linux/usr/lib => /usr/lib32 transition.
    - Cleanup /etc/init.d/fglrx-driver.

    - Loading the XVideo Extension on 64-bit Xorg 6.9+ systems no longer
      results in the X Server segfaulting when launching.
      This issue was known to occur with Radeon X1K products.
    - Running aticonfig--dtop=(horizontal|vertical) no longer results in clone
      mode being activated when attempting to enable big desktop mode.
    - Switching between X Server and text console mode no longer results in
      a system failing to respond. [fixed in version 8.32.5]

    the X server log file any more.

  * Add patch 20-fglrx-8.34.8-for-2.6.20 to support kernel 2.6.20;
    thanks to "Whoopie" for the patch and to Soeren for the link.

  * Change debian/rules and debian/control to hardcode X implementation and
    version. Now we just depend on X.Org version 7.0 and above.

  * Update man pages. Daniel Leidert, the manpages maintainer, says Debian's
    docbook stuff is hopelessly outdated, so I'm using precompiled man pages
    provided by Daniel instead of building them from the DocBook sources.
    Therefore, also remove the docbook stuff from the build dependencies.

    of the few files that are actually source code, but hand-picking only the
    files we actually use would be a tedious and error-prone process.
    (Closes: #341077)
    - Update copyright file accordingly.
    - Add build dependency on rpm.

  * dpkg-divert can't move files between different filesystems. Therefore,
    divert libGL to a subdirectory of /usr/X11R6/lib rather than /usr/share:
    the latter can in fact be on a different filesystem, if I understand the
    FHS correctly. On amd64, the same reasoning applies to the diversion of
    the 32-bit libGL: keep it within /emul/ia32-linux.
    (Closes: #341458)
    - This change involves some trickery with dpkg-divert. I tested several
      upgrade and downgrade scenarios and I hope I got it right, but please
      keep an eye open for any mishaps.
    - While we're at it, libGL is not architecture-independent so placing it
      anywhere within /usr/share was incorrect anyway...

  * Add dummy file "debian/include/fglrx_pp_proto.h" to be able to build the
    control panel's source code without patching it.
  * Don't ignore errors when building the control panel.
  * Add man pages from Daniel Leidert.
  * Set versioned dependency in the -dev package.
  * The driver suggests the control panel.
  * Fix handling of DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS:
    - let dh_strip handle "nostrip";
    - honor "noopt" and pass CFLAGS to sub-makes and gcc.
  * Make lintian happy (or at least happier):
    - remove unneeded extra license files;
    - add ldconfig symlinks for the shared libraries;
    - add overrides for a few problems we can't fix, at least for now.
  * Fix debian/rules to avoid installing CVS directories.

fglrx-driver (8.19.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. Highlights from the release notes:
    - PowerPlay(tm) Support
    - fgl_glxgears Update
    - Initial Suspend and Resume Support
    - The latest proprietary driver introduces a resolution for drmMap
      failures on 64bit NLD9 SP2 and 64bit Ubuntu Breezy distribution,
      resolving an issue that prevented 3D acceleration.
    [thanks to Alexandru for the patch]
  * Initial upload to Debian.
    - Include the complete license in debian/copyright.
    - Rename control panel package from fglrx-control-qt3 to fglrx-control.
    - Remove fglrx-sources package, it belongs in the source package.
  * Stop patching the control panel source code due to licensing issues; this
    is a workaround until ATI changes clause 1.d.vi of the license.

fglrx-driver (8.18.8-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version (minor update).
  * Updated desktop file.
    [thanks to Daniel Leidert]
  * Remove call to QApplication::setStyle() from panel/main.cpp, because:
    - it was overriding the user's preferred window style;
    - it caused compilation errors in some cases.
    [thanks to Aaron for the patch]
  * Clean up the control panel's makefile; among other things, stop creating a
    bzipped copy of the panel binary that we don't use.
  * Moved binaries from usr/X11R6/bin to usr/bin.
  * Kernel 2.6.14 removes register_ioctl32_conversion() for AMD64.
  * Build-Depends on libstdc++5 because the prebuilt binaries require it.

    - Enhanced Support for OpenGL Development
    - Dual Link Monitor Support
    - Xinerama Support
    - New X Server Configuration Utility
    [thanks to Alexandru for the patch]
  * Updated Build-Depends to handle both XFree86 and X.Org packages, as
    suggested by Michel Dänzer and others.
  * Add --referer=ati.com to the wget command line.

fglrx-driver (8.14.13-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: run dh_shlibdeps with --exclude=emul to avoid errors on
    32-bit libraries when building the 64-bit packages.
    - We're not interested in 32-bit library dependencies anyway; users that
      want to run 32-bit applications should install ia32-libs separately.

fglrx-driver (8.14.13-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Create directory "usr/share/fglrx/diversions" in the preinst script again,
    because the package hasn't been unpacked yet at this point.
    - Unfortunately, due to what appears to be a bug in dpkg-divert, if you
      installed 8.12.10-2 from scratch rather than upgrading, it's very likely
      that the existing /usr/X11R6/lib/libGL.so.1.2 has been deleted. This has
      no consequences until the fglrx driver is installed, but if you remove
      it in the future, you'll need to reinstall xlibmesa-gl.
  * [amd64] AMD64 RPMs are in a different directory.
    [thanks to Alexandru for the hint]
  * [amd64] Patch libGL.so at package creation, not during build.

fglrx-driver (8.12.10-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Build-Depend on x-dev and libx11-dev rather than the
    transitional xlibs-dev package.
  * debian/rules: remove no-longer-used $(README) target.
  * debian/rules: revamp build target to get rid of "build-stamp".
  * debian/rules: put directory "usr/share/fglrx/diversions" in the package
    rather than creating it in the preinst script.
  * debian/rules: run dh_strip to remove unneeded debug information.
  * debian/rules: removed --remove-files from the tar call because
    a) it's pointless, as it is followed by "rm -r modules" already and
    b) doesn't work with tar 1.15 that wants options before file names.
    [thanks to Eduard Bloch and others for noticing this]
  * debian/rules: compress the module tarball with bzip2 and name it
    "fglrx.tar.bz2"; update instructions accordingly.
    [thanks to Eduard Bloch for the suggestion]
  * module/rules: warn the user if the unpacked source doesn't match the
    installed fglrx-kernel-src package's version.
  * module/control.template: upgrade Recommends: to Depends: fglrx-driver.
  * [amd64] Add ia32-libs to Build-Depends.
  * [amd64] Patch usr/X11R6/lib64/libGL.so.1.2 to fix the lib64 issue;
    Build-Depend on rpl for this purpose.

  Changes by Eduard Bloch:
  * debian/README.Debian: removed the long collection of module-assistant
    calls with kernel-source specs again and again.
  * debian/control: moved kernel-package from Depends to Recommends in
    fglrx-kernel-src (it does not require it, even documented in
    README.Debian) and added module-assistant as alternative.

fglrx-driver (8.12.10-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. Thanks to Alexandru for the patch.
  * debian/rules: handle X.Org 6.8.2 (yes, I switched to Ubuntu's X.Org).
  * debian/patches-8.10.19/panel.diff: expand the "environment incomplete"
    error message in the panel's Makefile to show exactly what it was looking
    for, i.e. "$(MK_QTDIR)/include/qglobal.h"; hopefully, people seeing such
    message will understand that they need to install the Qt3 header files.

  * Ooops... "README.Debian" wasn't being put in the binary packages. Moved
    it into the debian directory so dh_installdocs finds it.
  * Add patches to support kernel 2.6.11:
    - 09-agp_backend
    - 10-remap_pfn_range
    - 11-four-level-pagetables
  * Add more patches in the limbo directory, and also put them in the kernel
    module's source tarball. Thanks to Alexandru for the patches.
  * Add Conflicts: nvidia-glx to fglrx-driver.
  * Change some Recommends: to Suggests:.

  * X.Org support! Thanks to Alexandru.
    - Note that I'm not building binary packages for AMD64 and X.Org, you'll
      need to build them yourself.
  * Removed changelog entries before 8.8.25 to unclutter the web page; they
    are still available as "changelog.old" for those interested.

fglrx-driver (8.8.25-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Trying to support module-assistant:
    - drop XFree86 version from package names
    - drop XFree86 and package versions from kernel source tarball's name
    - create link /usr/share/modass/packages/fglrx-kernel-src -> default.sh
  * Patch from Øystein Gisnås to make 'make-kpkg modules' work. It had been
    sitting in my inbox for a while now...
  * Support for previous driver versions has been removed to unclutter things
    a little bit.
